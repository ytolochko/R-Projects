# R-Projects
Here I collect interesting projects that I have completed using R. 

Currentely, there are 3 projects:


## assignment1-md-tolochko-yurii
Here the main objective is to make sense of the data from the Asian Barometer Survey 2010 in China (ABS2010.csv).
Intitially I use descriptive statistics to determine the quality of the data at hand. 
Thereafter, I make use of different survey designs in order to estimate a mesure of attitudes towards democracy, taking into accoutthe corrections for the skewed sample distribution.   
Next tasks relate to nonresponse issues and the possible ways of alleviating them - simple imputation, stochastic imputation and, most imporantly, mulitple imputation, which is the most effective and advanced method for imputing missing values.
