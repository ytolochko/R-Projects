# R-Projects
Here I collect interesting projects that I have completed using R. 

Currentely, there are 3 projects:


## assignment1-md-tolochko-yurii
Here the main objective is to make sense of the data from the Asian Barometer Survey 2010 in China (ABS2010.csv).
Intitially I use descriptive statistics to determine the quality of the data at hand. 
Thereafter, I make use of different survey designs in order to estimate a mesure of attitudes towards democracy, taking into accoutthe corrections for the skewed sample distribution.   
Next tasks relate to nonresponse issues and the possible ways of alleviating them - simple imputation, stochastic imputation and, most imporantly, mulitple imputation, which is the most effective and advanced method for imputing missing values.  

## assignment1-md-tolochko-yurii
Here the main objective is to explore and investigate the link between the operational political ideology and
voting preferences in the USA for the last election. The data I work with is from American National Election Survey (ANES) 2016 (ANES Reduced 2016.csv).
What I do here is perform various methods of statistical analysis in order to obtain some insights into the common patterns of political ideology preferences as well as voters' behaviours. Thus, you can see among other things factor and principal component analyses in order to determining the driving indicators of political ideologies as well as for creating weighted indices of political leanings.
Next, I run a various logistic regression analyses in order to make inferences on how well can different variables (among others, preferences to increase federal budget in different policy areas) and the abovementioned indices predict the voting preferences.

## homework-md-tolochko-yurii
In this project the goal is to practive different sampling strategies. I then demonstrate how the choice of a sampling strategy can influence the final descriptive statitics of a variable.
